 * The purpose of this project is to help integrate the knowledge gained from
 * 	an entrepreneural finance class in my undergrad years at OU
 * It will have a graphical interface for the business's ratios 
 * Initial Data (Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Statement of Cash Flows) will
 * 	be passed in from the command line. The user will still be allowed to adjust 
 * 	the imported values through the graphic windows as time progresses.

		// ratios should be static, only adjusted the output from the imported files
		// TODO design mockups for ratio graphic design (can probably +
		//		just use jframe implementation) (would be best to import a +
		//		graphics library for resume build)
